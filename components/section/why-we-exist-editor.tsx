    <h1>Why We Exist</h1>

    <p>Ever wondered why most brands hide their ingredient list, in microscopic font, at the back? Why you're made to stare, squint eyed, at the crimp, just to figure out what your food is made of?</p>

    <p>As an obese kid trying to eat healthy, I used to ask these questions everyday. I never got an answer, so I did my own research.</p>

    <p>Brands hide what goes into their food, because they have something to hide. Because they'd rather have you drool over fake pictures of molten, drippy chocolate, than have you discover that your food contains artificial sugars and preservatives and other hard-to-pronounce chemicals.</p>

    <p>In the name of 'healthy', we're being sold a bunch of lies. And I was done being lied to. So I, along with a few  like-minded (and equally betrayed) folks, started The Whole Truth.</p>

    <p>Our purpose is simple. We make food so clean, we can proudly declare every single ingredient that goes into it, upfront. And we can speak the whole truth, because we have #nothingtohide.</p>

    <p>Shashank, our main man, started his fitness journey at over 100kgs, 15 years ago. In the decade that followed, he taught himself fitness, lost 40kgs, ran several marathons, and helped many friends and colleagues get onto the fitness bandwagon.</p>

    <p>After all the years of research and self-experimentation, he believes there's only one universal food truth</p>

    <blockquote>good food is made of good ingredients</blockquote>
